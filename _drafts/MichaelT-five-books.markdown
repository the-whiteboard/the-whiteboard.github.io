# Five books

If you are old enough to remember book stores, you would walk past the
computer book shelve (or if you were lucky, shelves, or the *extremely*
fortunate would find an entire section of the book store dedicated to
computers and technology).

Now, those books aren't quite as accessible. It is harder to wander down
the aisle and thumb through a book to see if its worth while. While there
are online bookstores and temporary loans, that just doesn't have the
same accessibility of "open to a random page and see if it looks useful."

Thus, people often ask the classic question of "what do you recommend
reading?"  I'm also going to preface this with - I'm trying to stay away
from the classic classics. They are wonderful books, and others may
indeed recommend them for their value (and I'll admit to slipping one
of them on here).  I'm trying to name the books that you will not
necessarily have seen on the end-caps in the computer section of the
book store.  I'm admitting to wanting to be that guy who came up with the
eclectic mix tape that made you think a bit more than the classic
rock mix tape (that really rocks).

## [A Pattern Language](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0195019199/)

The first thing that will come to mind when seeing that title is "ug,
another book on patterns." Or maybe "I thought it was named *Design Patterns -
Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software*"

This isn't anything like that book. Or maybe it *should* be.  The full title
of the book is *A Pattern Language: Towns, Buildings, Construction*. Yes,
this is a book about architecture - but not *software* architecture. It is
about the houses and buildings that we walk live and work in.

The description of *A Pattern Language* is one that will sound very familiar
to people familiar with *Design Patterns*:

> It is shown [in *The Timeless Way of Building*], that towns and buildings
will not become alive, unless they are made by all the people in society,
and unless these people share a common pattern language, within which to
make these buildings, and unless this common pattern language is alive itself.
>
> In this book we present one possible pattern language, of the kind called
for in *The Timeless Way*.  This language is extremely practical. It is a
language that we have distilled from our own building and planning efforts
over the last eight years.  You can use it to work with your neighbors, to
improve your town and neighborhood.  You can use it to design a house for
yourself, with your family; or to work with other people to design an office
or a workshop or a public building like a school.  And you can use it to guide
you in the actual process of construction.
>
> The elements of this language are entities called patterns.  Each pattern
describes a problem which occurs over and over again in our environment, and
then describes the core of the solution to that problem, in such a way that
you can use this solution a million times over, without ever doing it the
same way twice.

This is the book that inspired Gamma, Helm, Johnson and Vissides.

By reading *A Pattern Language* you will be able to understand what the
authors of *Design Patterns* were trying to do and how design patterns
were intended to work.

It's a good book too, who knows what else you will find useful in it.
Pattern #146 describes a flexible office space.  Pattern #148 describes a
workspace for small work groups, #151 is about small meeting rooms, #152 is
a half private office.  Everyone who works in today's world of computers
and cubes, can use these ideas to conceptualize and consider improvements to
the office.

# [Programming Pearls](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0201657880/)

There are several things in this book that it has going for it.  The essay
"Cracking the Oyster" starts out with a simple question: "How do I sort
a disk file?". This question turns out to be probably the earliest documented
XY problem and the essay works through the *actual* problem that is being
sought. (A reading of this one and seeing someone else go through the process
of trying to figure out the problem should be required text for people who
keep getting their questions closed as 'unclear' on Stack Overflow
and Exchange).

The pearls of wisdom that this book provides - are in easy to digest short
chapters (its original form was that of a column in
[Communications of the ACM](http://www.bowdoin.edu/~ltoma/teaching/cs340/spring05/coursestuff/Bentley_BumperSticker.pdf)).
Each chapter stands on its own, as something that you can read quickly,
and take away something new from each time you read it.

Many of the problems, puzzles, and the solution to these puzzles are ones
that interviewers will ask.  Even looking at the process of how to solve the
problems interviewers *don't* ask, can be invaluable.

# [How To Be A Programmer](http://www.amazon.com/Robert-Reads-How-Be-Programmer/dp/1440439869/)

I've often quoted *How to be a Programmer*.  I first found it hosted at
[samizdat.mines.edu](http://samizdat.mines.edu/howto/HowToBeAProgrammer.html)
(now offline, though one can still find it through [archive.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20150906133633/http://samizdat.mines.edu/howto/HowToBeAProgrammer.html)),
though it has now found its way to [GitHub](https://github.com/braydie/HowToBeAProgrammer) with some updates since then.

I believe it to be an invaluable resource for readers of all skill levels.
From the fundamentals of *Learn to Debug* to to the point where you are
a senior developer and looking at *How to Get a Promotion* or
*How to Develop Talent*.  It is a text that has something for everyone.

This is the hard copy of it (or if you go for the Kindle version, the
softer copy).  It is essentially the same as the version online - just
something that is easier to carry about (don't get me wrong, the github
markdown version is wonderful - just that its a tad bit more difficult
to log into your server and view the markdown at night than it is
to pull out a kindle app on some device.

It is a good essay or book however you find it. Just a matter of
formatting.  And whatever the format, read it.

# [Managing Expectations: Working with People Who Want More, Better, Faster, Sooner, NOW!](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DY3KQJ0/)

The world of programming isn't only about code.  The previous book review
touched on that. The other half of the job is working with people.
Be it as a solo free-lancer, or a cog in a giant business - you will work
with other people.  And more than a few of those people are going to
demand things now.

Even if you find yourself with the most laid back boss, you will need
to communicate with him or her.  You will need to promise what you can
deliver and deliver what you promise.  Both failing to meet or exceeding
those commitments are possible issues.

This is a book about *communication*.  It is about making sure that we
are properly commutating with people about what we are doing, when we are
doing it, and what it will take to do it.  Not everyone we work with
will be a fellow programmer who we can drop into the deepest inscrutable
jargon with.  We need to make sure we communicate and avoid possible
conflicts that arise from that communication - and when those conflicts
do occur, figure out how to resolve them.

# [Slack](http://www.amazon.com/Slack-Getting-Burnout-Busywork-Efficiency/dp/0767907698/)

The full title is *Slack: Getting Past Burnout, Busywork and the
Myth of Total Efficiency*.  Quite a mouthful.  It is written by
Tom DeMarco of Peopleware fame.

Today's world is everyone [running the Red Queen's race](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Queen%27s_race).

> "Well, in our country," said Alice, still panting a little, "you'd
> generally get to somewhere else - if you run very fast for a long time,
> as we've been doing."
>
> "A slow sort of country!" said the Queen. "Now, here, you see, it takes all the running you can do, to keep in the same place. If you want to get somewhere else, you must run at least twice as fast as that!"

And the thing is, it is only by slowing down that we can move forward.

By having some slack in the schedule, we are able to respond to the
emergency in a timely manner and manage those risks.  It is that slack
hat allows the business to change as situations need.  Slack helps
reduce workplace stress and the feeling that when you are 'behind' you
need to go faster to catch up (which results in more errors).  The slack
is the opportunity to learn and grow.

This doesn't mean slack off, but rather that having slack allows people to
take up other tasks and situations as the organization needs it.  It allows
the organization to take risks and grow rather than spending all of its time
trying to become 'efficient' while losing the ability to be 'effective'.

Handing this book to your boss may or may not be a career limiting move.
DeMarco is rather critical of bad management. The ideas presented are
heretical in some organizations. And yet, it is one of those books that
plants seeds of ideas that have the possibility for making a better working
environment.
