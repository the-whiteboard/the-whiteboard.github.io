There are many things we talk about when assessing code and trying to construct
an analysis of its quality metrics. We talk about modularity in systems at the
large and small levels, we talk about coupling, we talk about performance
metrics, we talk about "Best Practices.” We talk about style, statefulness,
paradigm, elegance, smells, and so many different things.

However, we rarely talk about ***Reasoning***. It's rarely something mentioned in
interviews, code reviews, architectures, patterns, classes, or anywhere outside
of perhaps formalist maths training.

I would like to speak to this concept because I think it's something we oft
touch on in everything we do as programmers. Though we frequently interact with
the concept, reasonability is rarely given a label or defined in any sincere sense. Every
time we look at code and automatically find ourselves struggling to make out the
actual semantics, behaviour, and precise functionality of a piece of code
we're touching on the concept of ***Reasonability***. Every time you pick up a piece
of code you've never seen before and can find all of its actual behaviours
writ explicitly within that single piece, we are touching on the concept of
***Reasonability***.

Reasoning is something we do every day when we have to look at some code and
decide what it will do, and what it should do. Every time we are writing a piece
of code and trying to make its behaviour as clear as possible within its own
scope, we are focusing on making that code easy to reason about.

Reasonable code is what you get when you needn't look across multiple files, you
needn't look across a large section, or ponder with difficulty over many logical
decisions within the code itself.

Let's step back for a moment though.

What is ***Reasoning*** to begin with? It's so rarely spoken about that I think it's
worth giving a clear definition of, such that we may begin to utilize it as a
skill explicitly - as opposed to by accident or undefined habit.

I would give this definition for **Reasoning** where it relates to logical
analysis:

 > Reasoning: The act of mentally deducing by parts, the complete behaviour of a
 > logical system, such that given any input you can accurately assess all
 > outputs.

By this definition, I would lay claim that any section of code - from a single
block to an entire system is a **Logical System**. As such, we constantly find
ourselves reasoning through these systems - bit by bit - all day every day as
programmers. I believe the reason this is so infrequently mentioned or spoken of
is because the act is not only an obvious necessity to complete any given task
within the scope of being a programmer, but more importantly it generates no
visible outputs. With the entire act being invisible both to the participant and
any observer, it has resulted in making one of the key activities we as
programmers all practice, one which we have nearly no formal or conceptual
analysis of.

However, with the above simple definition of **Reasoning**, I think we can begin
to construct an entirely new approach to assessing code quality. One that takes
into account something we do far more frequently than nearly any other
activity where it regards interacting with code. The best part? While it's
somewhat subjective, while it's something we cannot assess computationally
because it depends on our individual anecdotal experiences interacting with
code, **it's the easiest metric to test code against of any**. You need no
tools but your own mind and a text editor.

To begin to assess the reasonability of code, all you need to do is take a piece
of code, look through it and measure how long it takes you to reason about every
facet of it. Practice doing this with your code, with code written by others,
practice doing it in the small and in the large. If you are attentive during
this process to the results you'll begin to notice patterns. These patterns
will stand out in regards to when code is very quickly reasoned through, and
when code takes a long time to reason through, and when you find code that you
simply cannot *completely* reason through.

These patterns are great to learn and recognize! These are *not* design
patterns! These are characteristics of code you will notice, when present affect
how easily you can reason through it.

Here now we get to the nitty gritty. I would like to list the characteristics I
have personally found makes code more **Reasonable**, such that I can complete the
act of **Reasoning** as defined above on the code with greater ease, speed, and
accuracy than code where these characteristics are not present.

* **Small scope**  
When a code section touches very few things outside of its own scope, up to
and including nothing outside of its own scope, this makes reasoning
through the sections entire behaviour far quicker and the understanding
I have of the code vastly more accurate.

* **Dictating instead of deciding**  
When a code section has very few logical decisions, but rather is actively dictating
what it will do without querying data to decide one way or another, the code
is often far more reasonable.

* **Explicit data use**  
When a code section is very explicit and specific in what data it is taking
as input, what it is doing to said data, and what data it is outputting, my
ability to reason through the completeness of its behaviour is often far
more accurate than when data is implicitly touched. For instance, if the
section of code makes a call to another section which implicitly changes
data, it takes more time for me to reason through the full systemic effect
of the original section of code.

* **Short stacks**  
When a code section calls into methods which call into methods which call
into methods until you have a very high chain of behaviours being executed,
the code becomes very difficult to reason about. This goes back to the point
about **small scope** - each section of code called by a single section is yet
another piece of the scope you must understand to fully reason about the
original section of code.

* **Explicit data ownership**  
When a code section makes clear that it *owns* the data it is interacting with
so that its data is completely inaccessible to other sections, it becomes
natural to reason through any changes you might make as you can be confident you
need not look at any other code section with concern for how you may be altering
its behaviours. An example is using data that is only local or data that is values
rather than references are two simple ways to ensure the data you are interacting
with will not affect other code sections.

* **Explicit outputs**  
When a code section uses its data in an explicit manner and makes explicit
what data it owns and doesn't own, it will often cause all outputs of the
section to be explicit as well. This is extremely helpful in reasoning about
what the code sections consumers are relying on and expecting.

The value in focusing on making your code reasonable is quite significant. You
will end up with code that is easy for new developers to pick up and
start editing. The code will be easier to integrate with other code, easier to
migrate to new technologies, and easier to recognize correctness or incorrectness.

No one language will cause these characteristics, and no one framework, library, or
technology will force them to occur. No matter what you are writing your code
with, you can effect these characteristics into it and practice attentiveness to
how well you and others can reason about your code, how well you and others can
reason about your system. As a result it becomes easy to reason about how
you will implement new changes - from bug fixes to enhancements, your ability to
see where and how you will effect these changes will improve drastically.

The characteristics I listed above are in no way comprehensive - or even
necessarily always accurate! The important point is to pay attention to the
process of reasoning about your code. To write it, and then attempt to sit and
look the horse in the mouth- and be self-critical of how well you can construct
a comprehensive and accurate mental model for its entire set of behaviours. The
more you practice this, the more you will begin to recognize which
characteristics make it quicker and easier to accomplish for you and others.
